# rl_ass3
compare.py performs the experiments
the following comments can be give in the command line
	"--re_tune_lr" -> runs tunning of learning rate for the REINFOCER agent
	"--re_tune_ew" -> runs tunning of entropy weight for the REINFORCE agent
	"--ac_tune_lr" -> runs tunning of learning rate for the ActorCritic agents
	"--ac_tune_ew" -> runs tunning of entropy weight for the ActorCritic agents
	"--env_speed" --> runs the different speeds in the enviroment experiment
	"--env_size" --> runs the different sizes of the enviroment experiment
	"--env_vector" --> runs the state as vector experiment in this case the flatten functie should be turned of in the actorcritic file.
	"--env_combi" --> runs the specific combination
